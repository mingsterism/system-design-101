for the menu page, we will get the menuItems. From there the user will get their order. 
Once they got their order, they can start placing orders. When they place orders, 
they can see their own individual orders. They can go to the group review to review the
orders that the whole group has provided. 
They can pay for their own individual orders. 
When paying for the group they can also do that by choosing to pay for everyone. 

When the restaurant creates tables, they can choose the number of tables they will want. 
They can specify where are the positions of the tables in the restaurant, and they can 
save the restaurant table coordinates.
